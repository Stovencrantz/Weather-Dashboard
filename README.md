## Description:
    Generates an html page that displays data for the current day and next 5 day weather forecast. The user enters a city and a state in the search bar and when they press the submit button it will update the site to display weather data for that location. This application utilizes local storage so the site will retain information from the users most recent search and will display it the next time the user opens the application.
